});
app.start();

app.get('/', function($){
    // set session data
    $.session.data.user = "guest";
  	$.session.save();
    
    // read session data
    console.log($.session.data.user)  // -> 'guest'    
    console.log($.session.data)      // -> { user: 'guest' }
    
    // destroy session
    $.cookies.destroy();
    
    $.end()
